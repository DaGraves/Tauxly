  <div>
    These terms and conditions ("Agreement") set forth the general terms and
    conditions of your use of the "Tauxly" mobile application ("Mobile
    Application" or "Service") and any of its related products and services
    (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement is legally binding between
    you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Mobile Application developer
    ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing and using the Mobile
    Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
    understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you
    are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal
    entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to
    this Agreement, in which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall
    refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do
    not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this
    Agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and
    Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you
    and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically
    signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application and
    Services.
  </div>

  <div>Accounts and membership</div>

  <div>
    You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Mobile Application and
    Services. By using the Mobile Application and Services and by agreeing
    to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 13
    years of age. If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you
    are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are
    fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and
    any other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no
    obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in
    and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of any
    kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately
    notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches
    of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
    including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
    omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part
    thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this
    Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our
    reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing
    reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your
    email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further
    registration.
  </div>

  <div>
    We do not own any data, information or material (collectively,

    using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy,
    quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and
    intellectual property ownership or right to use of all submitted
    Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review the
    Content in the Mobile Application submitted or created using our
    Services by you. You grant us permission to access, copy, distribute,
    store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user
    account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to
    you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we
    have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole
    discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
    opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or
    objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt,
    modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in
    your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose.

    SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with
    digital signatures, and the Mobile Application and Services are also in
    compliance with PCI vulnerability standards in order to create as secure
    of an environment as possible for Users. Scans for malware are performed
    on a regular basis for additional security and protection. If, in our
    judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will

    photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for
    the credit or debit card used for the purchase.

    and to change or update information or cancel orders if any information
    in the Mobile Application or Services is inaccurate at any time without
    prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). We
    undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the
    Mobile Application including, without limitation, pricing information,
    except as required by law. No specified update or refresh date applied
    in the Mobile Application should be taken to indicate that all
